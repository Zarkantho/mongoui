Memory Mapping 
mem.virtual: "virtual megabytes for the mongod process. Generally virtual should be a little larger than mapped, but if virtual is many gigabytes larger, that could indicate a memory leak - with journalling, virtual is twice mapped"

BTree
indexCounters.btree.missRatio: The ratio of misses to hits on the btree

Internal Alerts
asserts.warning: The number of warnings raised since this process started
asserts.msg: The number of message asserts. These are internal server errors that have a well defined text string. Stack traces are logged for these
asserts.user: The number of user asserts. These are errors that can be generated by a user such as out of disk space or duplicate key


Alers to Add:
205: Single Host Failure Point Alert (check host of the primary)?
