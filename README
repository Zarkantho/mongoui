Introduction:

MongoUI is a web app designed to provide a graphical way to view a MongoDB
cluster

Node.js must be installed to run MongoUI

Usage:

From the root directory of MongoUI, run:

node server.js [port]

This will run a node.js server listening on the given port (default 8080).  Open
"localhost:8080" in a browser to bring up the dashboard.

Once the dashboard is open, enter the host and port of any node in a MongoDB
cluster.  The server will automatically discover the whole cluster, and the
widgets will graphically display the results.
